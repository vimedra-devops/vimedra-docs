## 🚀 Why VIMEDRA?

Most healthcare systems miss what matters most — food, housing, transportation, and social stability. VIMEDRA goes beyond clinical care to deliver proactive, conversational, and culturally aligned support for underserved populations.

We combine:

- 🧠 **AI voice agents (Phoebe)** for 24/7 patient engagement
- 📊 **Socio-Medical Risk Engine (SRE)** — patent-pending tech blending clinical + social signals
- 💳 **VIMEDRA Wallet** — lets users earn and spend funds on eligible SDoH needs
- 🤝 **Support for care teams** — CHW tools, navigator guidance, and smart referrals

We’re proudly part of the NVIDIA Inception Program and currently piloting with FQHCs and state agencies in Florida.
