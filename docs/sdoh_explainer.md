# Understanding the Social Determinants of Health (SDoH)

## What Are SDoH?

Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) are the non-medical factors that influence health outcomes. These include the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age. Examples include:

- Access to food and clean water
- Safe and stable housing
- Transportation and mobility
- Education and health literacy
- Employment and income
- Community and social support
- Safety and exposure to violence

## Why SDoH Matter More Than Medical Care

Studies show that up to **80% of health outcomes are driven by SDoH**, while only 20% are influenced by clinical care. Addressing SDoH at scale is essential to reduce hospitalizations, improve chronic disease management, and close gaps in life expectancy across racial and economic lines.

## The Problem Today

Despite the clear impact of SDoH, most healthcare systems still treat these issues as secondary or outside their scope. Social workers are overburdened. Patients are left to navigate fragmented support systems on their own. Existing SDoH platforms often rely on clunky portals, outdated directories, and passive engagement.

## The VIMEDRA Approach

VIMEDRA is built from the ground up to *solve* the SDoH crisis. We use empathetic AI, proactive outreach, and a smart infrastructure to:

- **Screen** for social needs during real-time conversations
- **Connect** users to hyper-local resources instantly
- **Track** engagement and follow-up in real time
- **Reward** participation using an SDoH-specific digital wallet
- **Predict** unmet needs before they become crises

We believe that *every conversation is an opportunity to intervene.*

## Built for Equity

VIMEDRA prioritizes communities who are traditionally left behind by health tech: Medicaid patients, underinsured families, disconnected youth, and aging populations. We serve the people who need the most helpâ€”by giving them a voice, literally.
