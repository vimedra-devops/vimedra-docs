# How Phoebe Works: The Voice of VIMEDRA

## Who is Phoebe?

Phoebe is VIMEDRA’s AI-powered voice agent — a compassionate, intelligent, and proactive assistant built to address the Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) one conversation at a time.

Phoebe is not just a chatbot. She's an always-on, hyper-empathetic listener that interacts with patients via phone calls, web, or mobile app. Designed to sound human, act with care, and follow through, Phoebe helps people navigate everything from food insecurity to transportation needs.

## Why Voice?

Many underserved populations don’t have smartphones, data plans, or time to fill out long forms. But everyone has a phone. Phoebe bridges the access gap using:

- **Natural voice interactions**
- **Zero friction UX (no login or password needed)**
- **Multilingual support (English, Spanish, Creole, more coming)**

## A Typical Interaction

> **Phoebe:** Hi, this is Phoebe—your AI patient navigator. I wanted to check in and see how you’re doing today.  
> **User:** I lost my job and I’m worried about paying rent.  
> **Phoebe:** I’m sorry you’re going through that. I found three rental assistance programs near you. I can text you the links or help you apply — which do you prefer?

Phoebe doesn’t just answer questions. She builds trust, detects vulnerability, and makes action easier.
