**Phoebe:**  
Hi, this is Phoebe — I’m your AI patient navigator. I just wanted to check in and see how you’re doing today.

**Patient:**  
Honestly, not too great. I’m about to get evicted. I don’t know what to do.

**Phoebe:**  
I’m really sorry to hear that. You’re not alone, and there may be help available. Can I ask your ZIP code so I can search nearby programs?

**Patient:**  
33142.

**Phoebe:**  
Thanks. One moment...  
I found 3 emergency housing programs and 2 rental assistance services in your area. Would you like me to text you their contact info, or would you prefer we walk through the application together?

**Patient:**  
Let’s go through it together. I don’t want to mess it up.

**Phoebe:**  
Absolutely. I’ll help every step of the way. First, are you behind on rent for more than 30 days?

**Patient:**  
Yes.

**Phoebe:**  
Okay. I’ll begin the application for the Emergency Rental Assistance Program. I’ll ask a few quick questions. You can skip anything you’re unsure of.
